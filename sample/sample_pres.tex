\section{Definitions and Examples}



\frame{
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Recall that a {\bf tree} can be defined by one of several equivalent definitions.  In particular,
		\begin{itemize}
			\item<2-> A tree is a connected graph that does not contain any cycles.
			%\item<3-> A tree is a graph that is minimally connected (ie., it is connected, but the removal of any edge disconnects the graph).
			%\item<4-> A tree is a graph in which there exists a unique path between any distinct pair of vertices.
			\item<3-> A tree is a graph that can be constructed edge-by-edge, with each new edge including exactly one vertex from the previous graph (ie., the addition of each new edge requires the addition of one new vertex).
		\end{itemize}
		\hspace{.6in}\includegraphics[scale=.5]{tree.pdf}
	\item<4-> From this second definition, it follows that every tree contains at least one {\bf leaf} (a vertex of degree one).	
\end{itemize}
}




\frame{
\begin{itemize}
	\item The {\bf complete graph} $K_n$ is a graph of order $n$ in which every pair of distinct vertices are adjacent.
\end{itemize}

	\hspace{1.1in} $K_5$ \hspace{1.55in} $K_7$
}


\frame{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item<1-> The {\bf chromatic number} $\chi (G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices of $G$ so that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color.
		\item<2-> If $T$ is any tree containing at least one edge, then $\chi (T)= 2$.
		\item<3-> For all $n\in \N$, $\chi (K_n)=n$.
	\end{itemize}
}



\frame{
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> For any graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, the {\bf Ramsey number} $R(G_1, G_2)$ is the least natural number $p$ such that every red/blue coloring of the edges of $K_p$ contains a red subgraph isomorphic to $G_1$ or a blue subgraph isomorphic to $G_2$.
	\item<2->  The existence of Ramsey numbers follows from Frank Ramsey's foundational work [4].
\end{itemize}
}



\frame{
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Properties of $R(G_1, G_2)$:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item<2-> $R(K_1, G_2)$\uncover<3->{ $=1$, for all graphs $G_2$.}
		\item<4-> $R(K_2, G_2)$\uncover<5->{ $=n$, for all graphs $G_2$ of order $n$.}
		\item<6-> $R(G_1, G_2)=R(G_2, G_1)$, for all graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$.
	\end{enumerate} 
\end{itemize}
}






\section{The Work of Chv\'atal and Harary}


\frame{
In 1972, Chv\'atal and Harary [2] proved the following theorem.
\begin{theorem}[Chv\'atal and Harary] For all graphs $G_1$ and $G_2$, $$R(G_1, G_2)\ge (c(G_1)-1)(\chi (G_2)-1)+1,$$ where $c(G_1)$ is the order of the largest connected component in $G_1$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<2-> From this result, it follows that if $T_m$ is any tree of order $m$, then $$R(T_m, K_n )\ge (m-1)(n-1)+1.$$
\end{itemize}
}




\frame{
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Observe that $T_1=K_1$ and $T_2=K_2$.
	\item<2-> We can confirm that the lower bounds proved by Chv\'atal and Harary are exact in the following cases:\begin{align} R(T_1,K_n)\ge (1-1)(n-1)+1=1, \notag \\ R(T_2, K_n)\ge (2-1)(n-1)+1=n. \notag 
\end{align}
	\item<3-> In fact, in 1977, Chv\'atal [1] proved that this is always the case.
\end{itemize}
}



\frame{
\begin{theorem}[Chv\'atal] For every tree $T_m$ of order $m$, $$R(T_m, K_n)=(m-1)(n-1)+1.$$
\end{theorem}
}





%\section{The Proof of Chv\'atal's Theorem}

\frame{\frametitle{The Proof of Chv\'atal's Theorem}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> It remains to be shown that $$R(T_m, K_n)\le (m-1)(n-1)+1,$$ for all trees $T_m$ of order $m$.
	\item<2-> We proceed by (strong) induction on $m+n$.
	\item<3-> The Ramsey numbers $$R(T_1, K_n)=1=R(T_m, K_1)$$ are the base cases.
	\item<4-> Inductive hypothesis: suppose that $$R(T_{m'}, K_{n'})\le (m'-1)(n'-1)+1$$ for all $m'+n'<m+n$.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{The Proof of Chv\'atal's Theorem}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Consider a red/blue coloring of the edges in $K_{(m-1)(n-1)+1}$.
	\item<2-> Let $T'$ be the tree formed by removing a single leaf from $T_m$ and denote by $x$ the vertex in $T'$ that was adjacent to the removed leaf.
	\item<3-> By the inductive hypothesis, $$R(T', K_n)\le (m-2)(n-1)+1<(m-1)(n-1)+1.$$
	\item<4-> It follows that there exists a red $T'$ or a blue $K_n$.  Suppose the former case.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{The Proof of Chv\'atal's Theorem}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> So, our coloring contains a red $T'$.  Other than the $T'$, there are $$(m-1)(n-1)+1-(m-1)=(m-1)(n-2)+1$$ other vertices.
	\item<2-> Applying the inductive hypothesis again, we find that $$R(T_m, K_{n-1})\le (m-1)(n-2)+1.$$
	\item<3-> Hence the two coloring of the remaining vertices contains either a red $T_m$ or a blue $K_{n-1}$.  Assume the latter case.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{The Proof of Chv\'atal's Theorem}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Thus, the original red/blue coloring of $K_{(m-1)(n-1)+1}$ contains a red $T'$ and a blue $K_{n-1}$ that are disjoint.
	
	 \includegraphics[scale=.5]{treecomplete1.pdf}
	 \item<2-> Consider the edges connecting $x$ to the vertices in the blue $K_{n-1}$.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{The Proof of Chv\'atal's Theorem}
 \includegraphics[scale=.5]{treecomplete2.pdf}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<2-> If any such edge is red, then we obtain a red subgraph isomorphic to $T_m$.
	\item<3-> Otherwise, all such edges are blue, and a blue $K_n$ is formed.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{\frametitle{The Proof of Chv\'atal's Theorem}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> We have proved that every red/blue coloring of $K_{(m-1)(n-1)+1}$ contains a red $T_m$ or a blue $K_n$.
	\item<2-> Hence, $$R(T_m, K_n)\le (m-1)(n-1)+1,$$ completing the proof of the theorem. \hspace{1.4in}$\square$
\end{itemize}
}

\section{Conclusion}







\frame{
Concluding Remarks:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item<1-> A similar proof using induction can be used to show that $$R(T_m, K_{1,n})\le m+n-1,$$ where $K_{1,n}$ is a star (a tree with $n$ leaves and one vertex of order $n$).
	\item<2-> When a connected graph $G$ of order $m$ satisfies $$R(G, K_n)\le (m-1)(n-1)+1,$$ it is called {\it $n$-good}.  Ongoing research focuses on classifying all $n$-good graphs.
	%\item<3-> Results similar to those of Chv\'atal and Harary exist for hypergraphs, but few explicit evaluations of the corresponding Ramsey numbers are known.
\end{enumerate}
